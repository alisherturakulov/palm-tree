  # Project Ideas for Winter Hackathon
  -  Computer Vision project with ai model like YOLO
  -  Clarifying pixelated images
  -  game; checkers; chess
  -  tech stack: processing, c++, java, vibe coding, reverse learning
  -  Weather API, machine learning, snowfall levels based on different factors
  -  Location detection
    
# Concluding ideas
-  Image processing / Clarifying images 

# Finalizing Ideas/New Ideas Potentially
-  Finding locations using Google Maps API and maybe add wrapper for something
-  Needs YOLO and OpenCV
-  GPT Wrapper?
